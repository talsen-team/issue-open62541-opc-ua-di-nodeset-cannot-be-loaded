# Issue when building and loading DI model

How to reproduce the error:

1. install relevant dependencies  
   sudo /bin/bash install-dependencies.sh
2. build and run example application  
   /bin/bash build-and-run.sh

The application exits with an error when loading the DI model ([src/main.c] line 22).
